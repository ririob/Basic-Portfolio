            <p>My name is Richard Obaseki, I am a curious minded person who is always fascinated with technology. I am currently learning how to be a programmer and I hope to be a full stack developer soon.</p>

            <p>I have a high school degree and I will be continuing my higher education for my Bachelors and so on.</p>

            <p>I love traveling and I haven't done much in that area but I still have chances to do so. Contact me if you are looking for a developer who is always eager to learn.</p>
